## Description

My motivation is to build good looking websites that are intuitive and effecient. I wish to easily communicate information from my code to the finished webpage. I built this project to have a better foundation on the basics of html and css. It has simple classes and follows and logical structure of a website. It contains numerous sections and elements that make up a simple webpage. I learned how to use simple styles in css and how to apply styles to multiple elements at the same time, thus making cleaner code. I also learned how to correctly use semantic elements to make the code follow a logical order. 

## Installation

The webpage is available at https://zachcygan.github.io/bootcamp-challenge01-html_css/.

You can view any elements on the webpage or any of the styling by selecting the corresponding section in Chrome DevTools.
