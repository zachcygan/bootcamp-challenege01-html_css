My motivation is to build good looking websites that are intuitive and effecient. I wish to easily communicate information from my code to the finished webpage. I built this project to have a better foundation on the basics of html and css. It has simple classes and follows and logical structure of a website. It contains numerous sections and elements that make up a simple webpage. I learned how to use simple styles in css and how to apply styles to multiple elements at the same time, making cleaner code.
